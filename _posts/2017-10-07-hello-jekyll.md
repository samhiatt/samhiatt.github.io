I wanted to start building out a space here to share about projects I'm working on. I may stick to just sharing about software, or it may end up with a broad scope covering things like music, art, or even yoga too. I'm not really sure. In fact, come to think of it I don't actually know who I'm writing to. so I suppose I'll just say hi to you Jekyll.

Hello [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'm glad we met. I'm glad that you speak [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and can translate it into beautiful, clean web pages. It seems like you're an ideal candidate for a blog engine.

But what I think makes you super cool is the way you work so nicely with [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) who has been a friend of mine for many years now, managing and versioning my [git](https://git-scm.com/) repos with impeccability. I knew that Octocat would host generated static web pages here at my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hostname. But what I didn't know was how easy you, Jekyll, make it to author a blog here.

So cool. After [getting you set up with Octocat](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), all I have to do is create a file named `_posts/2017-10-07-hello-world.md`, add a special header with at least a `title` and `date`, and then write some markdown like this:
```
---
title: Hello world
date: 2017-10-07
---
###### An Example  
Here's an example I'd like to share:  
```javascript  
console.log("Hello world!");  
```                             ...
```

And you and Octocat will automatically build that into a static web page that looks like this:
> #### An Example  
> Here's an example I'd like to share:  
> ```javascript  
> console.log("Hello world!");  
> ```  

So now I don't even need a development machine/server in order to write my posts. Technically all I need is a browser logged into my GitHub account, I can create a new markdown file in the `_posts` folder, commit the file, and Octocat will automatically build and host it as a static web page. So nice.  

And Jekyll, you look so good in the [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) theme. It's a nice, clean-cut, minimalist design, yet responsive too, so you even look good to tiny mobile devices. And I like its fancy, open source MIT license, which allows me to special tailor it for you, ya know, in case you change.
